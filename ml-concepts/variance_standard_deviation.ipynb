    "## Exploration of variance and standard deviation\n",
    "[From wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance):\n",
    "\n",
    ">There are two distinct concepts that are both called \"variance\". One, is part of a theoretical probability distribution and is defined by an equation. The other variance is a characteristic of a set of observations. When variance is calculated from observations, those observations are typically measured from a real-world system. If all possible observations of the system are present, then the calculated variance is called the population variance. Normally, however, only a subset is available, and the variance calculated from this is called the sample variance. The variance calculated from a sample is considered an estimate of the full population variance.\n",

    "### Variance\n",
    "Variance measures how far a set of numbers are spread out from their average (mean). It quantifies the degree of variation or dispersion in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mathematical Definition**:  \n",
    "    Variance for a finite set of samples $\\sigma^2$ is calculated as:  \n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\mu)^2\n",
    "    $$  \n",
    "    Where:\n",
    "    - $N$: Number of data points\n",
    "    - $x_i$: Each individual data point\n",
    "    - $\\mu$: population average of the quantity measured\n",
    "\n",
    "    The variance of a random variable $X$ is the expected value of the squared deviation from the mean of $X$, $\\mu = \\operatorname{E}[X]$:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\operatorname{E}\\left[(X - \\mu)^2\\right]\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    This definition encompasses random variables that are generated by processes that are discrete, continuous, neither, or mixed. The variance can also be thought of as the covariance of a random variable with itself:\n",

    "    $$\n",
    "    \\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\operatorname{Cov}(X, X)\n",

    "- **Analogy**: Imagine a group of runners on a track. Variance tells us how far apart the runners are from each other and from the average position. A high variance means the runners are spread out, while a low variance means they are clustered together.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Practical Meaning**: A higher variance indicates greater variability in the data, while a lower variance suggests the data points are closer to the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard Deviation\n",
    "Standard deviation is the square root of variance. It provides a measure of dispersion in the same units as the data, making it more interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mathematical Definition**:  \n",
    "    Standard deviation for a finite set of samples $ \\sigma $ is calculated as:  \n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\mu)^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\mu)^2}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analogy**: Using the same runners analogy, standard deviation tells us the average distance of the runners from the mean position, but in the same unit as the track (e.g., meters).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Practical Meaning**: A smaller standard deviation means the data points are tightly clustered around the mean, while a larger standard deviation indicates more spread.\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "Variance and standard deviation both measure the spread of data, but standard deviation is often preferred for practical applications due to its interpretability. Together, they provide valuable insights into the variability of a dataset. They are both a measure of dispersion with respect to the average of mean of the data or distribution."
