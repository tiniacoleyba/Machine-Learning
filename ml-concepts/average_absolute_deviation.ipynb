    "# Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of Average Absolute Deviation (AAD)\n",
    "[From wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_absolute_deviation)\n",
    "\n",
    ">The average absolute deviation (AAD) of a data set is the average of the absolute deviations from a central point. It is a summary statistic of statistical dispersion or variability. In the general form, the central point can be a mean, median, mode, or the result of any other measure of central tendency or any reference value related to the given data set. AAD includes the mean absolute deviation and the median absolute deviation (both abbreviated as MAD). \n",

    "One can interpret the average absolute deviation from the mean as a measure of dispersion around a central point, in this case, the mean. \n",
    "It represents how far apart we expect a value to be from the central point.\n",
    "It is also useful to compute the dispersion in relative terms, that is, what's the ratio between the AAD and the central point value?\n",

    "For example, from the computations above we see that the AAD of blood pressure (bp) is 12.1% (0.121) of the average value of bp, which has an easier interpretaion than the AAD of 11.4 bp points."
