    "## 1. **What is a variable in statistics?**  \n",
    "A variable in statistics is a characteristic or property that can take on different values. It represents data that can vary across observations or experiments. For example, height, weight, and age are variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, a variable is denoted by a symbol, such as $X$, which can take on values from a set $\\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables can be of many times and can be classified according to different criteria. For our purposes, variables can be deterministic, random or anything in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 **What is a deterministic variable in statistics?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A deterministic variable is a variable that has a fixed value or outcome that does not change under the same conditions. Unlike random variables, deterministic variables are not influenced by chance or randomness. Their values are predictable and constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 **Differences between deterministic and random variables:**\n",
    "1. **Predictability:**\n",
    "    - Deterministic variables have predictable and fixed values.\n",
    "    - Random variables have values that are determined by random phenomena and are not predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dependence on randomness:**\n",
    "    - Deterministic variables are not influenced by randomness.\n",
    "    - Random variables are inherently influenced by randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Examples:**\n",
    "    - Deterministic variable: Number of sides on a die (always 6).\n",
    "    - Random variable: Outcome of rolling a die (varies between 1 and 6).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3 **Similarities between deterministic and random variables:**\n",
    "1. **Representation:**\n",
    "    - Both deterministic and random variables can be represented mathematically.\n",
    "    - For example, a deterministic variable can be represented as a constant, while a random variable is represented as a function mapping outcomes to values.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### **Are two random variables identically distributed if they both come from normal distributions but have different means or variances?**\n",
    "No, two random variables are not identically distributed if they have different means or variances, even if both come from normal distributions. Identical distribution requires the same probability distribution, including identical parameters (mean and variance for normal distributions).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Are two random variables identically distributed if they come from different probability distributions such as a normal and a lognormal distribution but have the same mean and standard deviation?**\n",
    "No, two random variables are not identically distributed if they come from different probability distributions, even if they have the same mean and standard deviation. Identical distribution requires the same type of distribution, not just matching moments like mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Are two identically distributed random variables the same?**\n",
    "\n",
    "No, two identically distributed random variables are not necessarily the same random variable. Identical distribution means that the two random variables have the same probability distribution, but they can still represent different random phenomena or outcomes. The key difference lies in their independence and the context in which they are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Why not?**\n",
    "1. **Different sample spaces:** Two random variables can have the same distribution but be defined on different sample spaces or represent different experiments.\n",
    "2. **Independence:** Identically distributed random variables can be independent of each other, meaning the value of one does not affect the value of the other.\n",
