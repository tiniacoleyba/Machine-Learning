# Why concepts
This file contains keywords and concepts I have been interested in and studied related to Data Science.
The ideal data scientist (DS) would know three core technical pillars in depth: mathematics,
software engineering, and his particular business area. So, DS is a cross-disciplinary role.
A world-class data scientist must be excellent in each of those pillars but not necessarily as 
good as a person who focuses only on one of the pillars. 
For example, a DS is not expected to be better than a mathematician in mathematics 
but is certainly expected to know some fields in depth, such as statistics.
