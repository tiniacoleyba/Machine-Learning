    "# Bernoulli probability distribution\n",
    "The **Bernoulli probability distribution** is a discrete probability distribution for a random variable which takes the value 1 with probability $p$ and the value 0 with probability $1-p$. It models the outcome of a single experiment (trial) that has exactly two possible outcomes: \"success\" (1) and \"failure\" (0).\n",
